Hi!
Welcome to my website. Since forever I've wanted to have my own website, and here it is!

I knew HTML since long, but never really felt like making web pages, despite my desires. However, I recently discovered why, when I started learning CSS. Man can I now make some good-looking websites!

Lol kidding, I've just started out and am a big noob at this, but it's fun and that's what the point is, so yay!

Cheerio!!
